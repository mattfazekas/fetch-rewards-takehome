Data Diagram Notes:

Users table was fairly straightforward to create from source data. Only difference from the description I was given was
the addition of a SignupSource column that includes text describing the source of the account, likely for marketing purposes.
ID would be the unique identifer for this table, though duplicates exist.


Brands table was mostly straightforward, although I broke out the cpg field into an ID and the reference. 
From the data I was give, there is a missing link to connect brands with items on receipts. Notes I was given suggest the existence
of a PartnerProducts table that would serve to join brand IDs to item IDs. The barcodes in the brand table don't correspond to products,
nor should they - my interpretation is that the barcodes reference the actual *brand*, though based on my real life experience I'm not sure
what these mean - do brands like Betty Crocker, Starbucks, Snapple share some segment of individual products among themselves? 
Based on the data I was given, I don't define any relationships between the other tables in my model. 

Technically, some CPG IDs are referenced within the receiptItems, but not in a way that makes sense to me 
(ex: A record for a purchase of Annie's Mac & Cheese has a pointsPayerID and rewardsProductPartnerID that matches several cpgIDs in the 
brands table, but the brand records aren't Annie's - so I feel like there's context I'm missing). 
I imagine there is another table that details CPG info that I would use in a more refined model.


The receipts table took the most work and I actually split this into 2 tables - a table for actual receipts, and a table for items on a 
unique receipt. Receipts have a userID on them to join back to the users table, and the table keeps info about the sanned receipt as a whole.

The receiptItem table is created from the data stored in rewardsReceiptItemList, as well as the ID of the receipt it came from, to join on.
Here, a row is created for each item in the list, so there is a one-to-many relationship between receipts and receiptItems. Data was inconsistent
and tough to work with in its given form, so the field list in my model isn't exhaustive. Many records in the lists don't share fields, 
so more work would be required to fully account for all data present there.
